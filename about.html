        <ul class="rs">
            <li>Only use vanilla JavaScript, no framework or library allowed.</li>
            <li>Make it all on only one page.</li>
            <h3 class="rs-h3">EXEPTIONS:</h3>
            <li>Since there are two sliders, make one from scratch and one with a library.</li>
            <li>The 3D-section will be allowed to step outside the vanilla JS and the about-page shall be on a separate page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="about-header">Why this project?</h2>
        <p class="about-p">I wanted to make a project that could be taken to a real-life project and also add something extra to it, hence the
        3D-part.</p>

        <h2 class="about-header">No Database</h2>
        <p class="about-p">As said in my requirement specifications, the project will be written in vanilla js. Therefore I also chose to use
        localStorage instead of a separate database.</p>

        <h2 class="about-header">About the 3D</h2>
        <p class="about-p">First, feel free to click anything on these 3D animations. You will be able to change colors, move around, open and
        close drawers and doors. All models are build with Blender.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about-p">To save space in the application and to make it run faster, I run the 3D animations via CDN. This is quite
        expensive if you buy, so I use the free trial version. One of the downsides to this is that it will only store the files
        for 30 days. If you watch this page and you can't reach the 3D section, please let me know and I'll have it sorted asap.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about-p">Also, to keep everything fast and smooth, and to concentrate more on the code, the quality of the 3D-renders has been
        reduced, but I still hope that you can enjoy them.</p>

        <h2 class="about-header">Summary</h2>
        <p class="about-p">This is a portfolioÂ project and not a live version. Therefore not all the buttons and functions work.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="about-p">Enjoy the page and just let me know what you think or if something isn't working as you expect it to.</p>
